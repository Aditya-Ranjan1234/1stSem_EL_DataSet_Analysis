# Netflix Dataset Analysis

Welcome to the Netflix Dataset Analysis project! As a beginner this project is my first project with Python programming and data analysis using popular libraries lik
e NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. By working on this project, I learned how to explore and analyze real-world datasets.

This project is my first-semester Python course college project as it covers fundamental concepts of Python programming and data analysis step by step.

## Dataset Description

The Netflix dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix.

## Requirements

To get started with this project, you'll need:

- A basic understanding of Python programming.
- Python installed on your computer (version 3.x recommended).
- Familiarity with using a command-line interface (CLI).
- Eagerness to learn and explore!

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aditya-Ranjan1234/1stSem_EL_DataSet_Analysis.git
cd 1stSem_EL_DataSet_Analysis
```

2. Download the Netflix dataset and place it in the project directory.

3. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
